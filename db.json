Easing is described by an equation or set of\nequations. Using easing will make your animation look more polished and appealing.\n\n[Here](http://easings.net/) are visualization for several easing equations.\n\n## Caching\n\nEasing functions can get pretty complicated. They often include notoriously slow methods like sine or cosine. This\nmeans that you should cache your easing results.\n\nThe problem is that if your easing equations are not normalized to one unit of time and one unit of completion, then\nthis caching will not be useful.\n\nIn other words, pass in only a normalized `t`, so that you have the maximum chance of hitting a cached `y`. Basically,\nwe're drawing a curve, and once we calculate a point on that curve, we want to cache our calculation. If we don't\nnormalize our easing equation then we must draw many curves, but if we do normalize then we only need one curve, and\nso we can store points on that single curve from all our animations that share the same easing function.\n\nBelow is an example for easing in and out with a sine function:\n\n```javascript\neaseInOutSine = (function () {\n\n    // Our cache in a closure\n    var cache = {};\n\n    // The actual easing function returned to the user\n    return function(t) {\n\n    // If the value is not in the cache, put it in the cache\n    if (! cache[t]) {\n       cache[t] = -1/2 * (Math.cos(Math.PI * t) - 1);\n    }\n\n    // We return from the cache, knowing our value is there\n    return cache[t];\n    };\n}());\n```\n\n[**jsFiddle using the above**](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/VX5xK/show/) - ([code](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/VX5xK/))\n\nOr, if you are an [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) fan:\n\n```javascript\n// Use underscores built in memoize for caching\neaseInOutSine: _.memoize(function(t) {\n\n    return -1/2 * (Math.cos(Math.PI*t) - 1)\n})\n```\n\n[**jsFiddle using the above**](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/8kU85/show/) - ([code](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/8kU85/))\n\nThis complicates your animation equation, since you have to normalize your time and change intervals, but the\npayoff is a smoother animation, since you're doing fewer computations.\n\nThe above is better for caching then for example something like:\n\n```javascript\n// This is hard to cache, since there's going to be cache entries for each combination of arguments\neaseInOutSine: function (startValue, changeInValue, msElapsed, msDuration) {\n    return -changeInValue/2 * (Math.cos(Math.PI * msElapsed/msDuration) - 1) + startValue;\n},\n```\n\nNormalizing your easing equations to improve caching is fine and dandy, but it certainly isn't very user friendly unless\nyour easing equation or animation engine handles the normalization. Then you can go back to having nice arguments.\n\nThe disadvantage of rolling your normalization into your easing equation is that you have to recalculate the change\nin value from the start and end value at each tick. Also, it doesn't seem like normalization is a job for an easing\n equation. So, let's put the normalization into the animation engine.\n\nFor example, adding normalization to `easeInOutSine` and moving a box around would make something like:\n\n```javascript\n// The animation equation with user friendly arguments\n// This will take care of normalization before calling the easing equation,\n// * tickHook - function that get called on each tick with the updated number\n// * startNum - initial value\n// * endNum - final value\n// * duration - how long animation last in milliseconds\n// * callback - (optional) function to call when animation finishes\n// * easingEq - (optional) easing equation\n    var animate = function (tickHook, startNum, endNum, duration, callback, easingEq) {\n\n        var easingEq = easingEq || easing.easeInOutSine,\n            changeInNum = endNum - startNum,\n            startTime = new Date().getTime(),\n\n            // The engine that runs the animation\n            engine = function () {\n                var now = new Date().getTime(),\n\n                    // Calculate the normalized time elapsed for the easing function\n                    timeNorm = (now - startTime) / duration,\n\n                    // Calculate the normalized completion from the normalized time\n                    // using the easing function\n                    completionNorm = easingEq(timeNorm),\n\n                    // \"un-normalize\" to calculate the new actual number\n                    newNum = startNum + completionNorm * changeInNum;\n\n                if (now - startTime > duration) {\n\n                    if (callback) {\n                        callback();\n                    }\n                } else {\n\n                    // Update interested parties with the new number once per tick\n                    tickHook(newNum);\n\n                    // Kick off the next tick\n                    requestAnimationFrame(engine);\n                }\n            };\n\n        requestAnimationFrame(engine);\n    },\n// and the implentation goes here...\n```\n\n[**jsFiddle example**](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/gAAp2/show) ([code](http://jsfiddle.net/pajtai/gAAp2/))\n\nIn fact the caching could probably move out of the easing equation too in order to keep the equation clean.

They often include notoriously slow methods like sine or cosine. This<br>means that you should cache your easing results.</p>\n<p>The problem is that if your easing equations are not normalized to one unit of time and one unit of completion, then<br>this caching will not be useful.</p>\n<p>In other words, pass in only a normalized <code>t</code>, so that you have the maximum chance of hitting a cached <code>y</code>. Basically,<br>we’re drawing a curve, and once we calculate a point on that curve, we want to cache our calculation. If we don’t<br>normalize our easing equation then we must draw many curves, but if we do normalize then we only need one curve, and<br>so we can store points on that single curve from all our animations that share the same easing function.</p>\n<p>Below is an example for easing in and out with a sine function:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">easeInOutSine = (<span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">// Our cache in a closure</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> cache = &#123;&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">// The actual easing function returned to the user</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">t</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">// If the value is not in the cache, put it in the cache</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (!

Then you can go back to having nice arguments.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage of rolling your normalization into your easing equation is that you have to recalculate the change<br>in value from the start and end value at each tick. Also, it doesn’t seem like normalization is a job for an easing<br> equation. So, let’s put the normalization into the animation engine.</p>\n<p>For example, adding normalization to <code>easeInOutSine</code> and moving a box around would make something like:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br><span class=\"line\">33</span><br><span class=\"line\">34</span><br><span class=\"line\">35</span><br><span class=\"line\">36</span><br><span class=\"line\">37</span><br><span class=\"line\">38</span><br><span class=\"line\">39</span><br><span class=\"line\">40</span><br><span class=\"line\">41</span><br><span class=\"line\">42</span><br><span class=\"line\">43</span><br><span class=\"line\">44</span><br><span class=\"line\">45</span><br><span class=\"line\">46</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// The animation equation with user friendly arguments</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// This will take care of normalization before calling the easing equation,</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * tickHook - function that get called on each tick with the updated number</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * startNum - initial value</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * endNum - final value</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * duration - how long animation last in milliseconds</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * callback - (optional) function to call when animation finishes</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// * easingEq - (optional) easing equation</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> animate = <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"params\">tickHook, startNum, endNum, duration, callback, easingEq</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">        <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> easingEq = easingEq || easing.easeInOutSine,</span><br><span class=\"line\">            changeInNum = endNum - startNum,</span><br><span class=\"line\">            startTime = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>().getTime(),</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">            <span class=\"comment\">// The engine that runs the animation</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">            engine = <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"params\"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">                <span class=\"keyword\">var</span> now = <span class=\"keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"built_in\">Date</span>().getTime(),</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    <span class=\"comment\">// Calculate the normalized time elapsed for the easing function</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    timeNorm = (now - startTime) / duration,</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    <span class=\"comment\">// Calculate the normalized completion from the normalized time</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    <span class=\"comment\">// using the easing function</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    completionNorm = easingEq(timeNorm),</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    <span class=\"comment\">// \"un-normalize\" to calculate the new actual number</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">                    newNum = startNum + completionNorm * changeInNum;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">                <span class=\"keyword\">if</span> (now - startTime &gt;

This means it can be used to build a library of\nfunctions for later use and possible attachment to objects unrelated by an inheritance hierarchy.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a `greet` function. It takes two arguments: who to greet and what to greet with:\n\n```javascript\nfunction greet(name, greeting) {\n    alert(greeting + ', ' + name);\n}\n```\n\nIn certain situations, especially if this function is mixed into objects, you might end up always calling the function\nwith the same `name` argument.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Alarm(alarmOwner) {\n    this.alarmOwner = alarmOwner;\n}\n\n// Mixin the greet function\nAlarm.prototype.greet = greet;\n// Other alarm clock functions\n// ...\n```\n\nSince the alarm will always be greeting its owner, the `greet` method will always be called as follows:\n\n```javascript\nthis.greet(this.alarmOwner, greeting);\n```\n\nThe above is a procedural solution. We're feeding all the data into the function with arguments, and we're not using context.\nThe problem with it is that it can quickly become difficult to manage multiple such methods with many calls to each method.\n\nA possible object oriented solution is to modify the original `greet` function to use a field:\n\n```javascript\nfunction greet(greeting) {\n    alert(greeting + ', ' + this.name);\n}\n```\n\nThe above would work okay with our alarm clock, we could just add `this.name = this.alarmOwner` into the constructor.\nThe problem with this solution is that it ties the use of the method to the availability of a field. In other words, it\nis an object oriented approach, since object are combinations of data and methods. This means that\nyou have to know to add a `this.name` whenever you want to use `greet()`. This is okay, until you start working with\nan object that uses `this.name` for something else. For example let's say you have a CoffeeMaker whose `this.name` is\n`Model XTR4302`. When the CoffeMaker greets you in the morning, it should do so with your name, and not its own model\nname.\n\nThe solution is to put a slight twist on the procedural implementation of `greet(name, greeting)`, we can break the\nfunction into two chained functions. The first call of `greet` will take `name` as an argument, and it will return a\nfunction that has `name` baked into it. This second generated - curried - function can now be called with `greeting`, and\nit will always greet `name`.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n```javascript\nfunction greet(name) {\n\n    return function(greeting) {\n        alert(greeting + ', ' + name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method is powerful because it creates a customized function with the first call.

With currying you can do things like setup default options, and\nthen pass in specific options to finally return a customized function:\n\n```javascript\n// Start building your custom function by calling it with the default options object\nfunction customStuff(defaultOptions) {\n\n    // Continue building your custom function by calling it with your specific options for this case\n    return function(options) {\n\n        var config = {};\n\n        _.extend(config, defaultOptions, options);\n\n        // And now you have a customized function with access to the created options / config object, and it can\n        // also be called with any number of arguments\n        return function(arg1, arg2) {\n            // In here we have acces to the final config - a combination of the default and specific options\n            if (config.that && config.other) {\n                // do stuff with arg1 / arg2\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above is an example of how to customize a function use a combination of default and actual options objects.

It uses function references to do this.</em></p>\n<p>In programming a definition for currying is pretty easy to come by, but these definitions don’t generally communicate<br>the power of currying to most people.</p>\n<p>For example, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wikipedia’s curry page</a> we can read that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple<br>arguments (or a tuple of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions, each with a single<br>argument (partial application). It was originated by Moses Schönfinkel and later re-discovered by Haskell<br>Curry. Because of this, some say it would be more correct to name it schönfinkeling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That doesn’t sound very exciting, and unless you’re already familiar with currying, it’s difficult to see how this<br>technique can be used in every day JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Currying is a way to allow the customization of individual functions. This means it can be used to build a library of<br>functions for later use and possible attachment to objects unrelated by an inheritance hierarchy.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say we have a <code>greet</code> function. It takes two arguments: who to greet and what to greet with:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">greet</span>(<span class=\"params\">name, greeting</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    alert(greeting + <span class=\"string\">', '</span> + name);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In certain situations, especially if this function is mixed into objects, you might end up always calling the function<br>with the same <code>name</code> argument.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"title\">Alarm</span>(<span class=\"params\">alarmOwner</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.alarmOwner = alarmOwner;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Mixin the greet function</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">Alarm.prototype.greet = greet;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// Other alarm clock functions</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// ...</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Since the alarm will always be greeting its owner, the <code>greet</code> method will always be called as follows:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.greet(<span class=\"keyword\">this</span>.alarmOwner, greeting);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The above is a procedural solution.
