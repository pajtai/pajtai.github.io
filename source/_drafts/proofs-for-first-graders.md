I was listening to my wife help my daughter with her math homework. The assignment was to draw a rectangle chopped into 
4 equal pieces. Equal pieces of anything is pretty challenging for a first grader. She was trying to chop a big rectangle
into smaller equally portioned rectangles using a perfectly placed vertical and horizontal line. I commented that the easy
way to do it is to just draw 2 lines from corner to corner diagonally. My wife asked how I know that that divides the rectangle
into 4 equal pieces. I realized I didn't know and I was just making things up, but it turned out I was right, and here's the
proof that my daughter could follow.
