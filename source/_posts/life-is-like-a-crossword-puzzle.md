I'm not sure if you've done any crossword puzzles. In my experience, they seem most unsurmountable at the beginning. Initially you are faced with rows and columns of empty squares. Sometimes you have to read through each clue more than once before being able to fill in the first letter. Sometimes even after reading all the clues, you won't be able to fill in a single letter. At this point, I've found it tempting to give up, but if I just keep thinking eventually an answer will come to me. I'm not sure what, if anything changes, but sometimes the only way to get to that first initial answer is to sit with the discomfort of not knowing or understanding for a while. The ability to willingly be uncomfortable to achieve a goal is an undervalued skill.
